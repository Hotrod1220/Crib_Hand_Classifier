# Playing Card Classifier for Cribbage Scoring

## Overview
This project aims to create a playing card classifier using PyTorch, which can automatically identify playing cards from images. After recognizing the cards, the system will calculate your score in a game of cribbage based on the recognized hand.

## Inspiration
The idea for this project came from playing cribbage with coworkers during lunch breaks. We wanted to automate the scoring process of the game by recognizing the cards in hand and calculating the total score. This project uses deep learning and computer vision to achieve this goal.

## Features
- Card Recognition: Uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) built in PyTorch to identify cards from images.
- Cribbage Scoring: After recognizing the cards, the program calculates the cribbage score based on the rules of the game.
